# 2020 to 2023 US Congress members' stock transactions EDA.

This project delves into the stock transactions of US Congress members from 2020 to 2023, utilizing data provided by [House Stock Watcher](https://housestockwatcher.com/api). By conducting exploratory data analysis(EDA) on these transactions, I aim to uncover insights, patterns, and potential conflict of interest within the dataset.

The analysis is conducted using Python, leveraging the power of Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. These tools facilitate data wrangling, transformation, and visualization, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of the dataset.
