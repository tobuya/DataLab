# 2020 to 2023 US Congress members' stock transactions Analysis.

This project delves into the stock transactions of US Congress members from 2020 to 2023, utilizing data provided by [House Stock Watcher](https://housestockwatcher.com/api). By conducting exploratory data analysis on these transactions, I aim to uncover insights, patterns, and potential conflicts of interest within the dataset.

The analysis uses Python, leveraging the power of Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. These tools facilitate data wrangling, transformation, and visualization, allowing for a comprehensive dataset exploration.
